=> create a new CPointer instance with address = 0x1234
CPointer(0x1234) => CPointer instance

=> and for NULL address?
CPointer(0) and CPointer(None) return None.

=> Is CPointer() valid ?
-> Yes, give a None for CPointer.
-> For subclass, no rules. For example: RastPort() give a new allocated rastport.

=> create a new PyMuiObject instance (CPointer subtype):
PyMuiObject()
-> Don't give any arguments. No MUI object associated until _create() called with right arguments.

=> create a PyMuiObject from a NULL address:
-> Like CPointer

=> create a PyMuiObject instance from a existant C Object pointer.
PyMuiObject(0x1234) => instance
-> it's not a new instance. Just get the PyMuiObject from the given Object address, incref the py object and return it.
